An A* search implementation on a node map of NZ and Auckland

To use my code you simply
click two nodes to calculate the shortest path between them by distance, or click an empty
space to clear all selections. If you wish to find the fastest route, once you have clicked
your two nodes, then type "speed" exactly like that in the search box and if there is a faster
route the highlighted segments will change
